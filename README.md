# ðŸ§  Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** that predicts the **next word** in a given sequence of text. The model leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks â€” a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly effective for sequence prediction tasks.
